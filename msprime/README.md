This folder contains Python3 scripts to rerun the msprime analysis. It
requires the msprime Python package and numpy. To rerun the analysis,
use the scripts:

```
run_scenario_a.sh PATH-TO-DYSTRUCT PATH-TO-ADMIXTURE
run_scenario_b.sh PATH-TO-DYSTRUCT PATH-TO-ADMIXTURE 
```

Scenario A corresponds to the coalescent merger scenario in the paper.
Scenario B corresponds to the coalescent split scenario in the paper.
