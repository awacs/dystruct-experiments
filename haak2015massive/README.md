This folder contains scripts to rerun the analysis on the data from Haak et al.
(2015)'s "Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European
languages in Europe." Preprocessed data to provide as input to DyStruct and
ADMIXTURE are available in the compressed archive data.tar.gz.

Scripts to run DyStruct and ADMIXTURE for each K are in the folders

```
K#/run-haak2015massive-europe-K#.sh
K#/run-haak2015massive-oceania-K#.sh
K#-admixture/run-admix-haak2015massive-europe-K#.sh
K#-admixture/run-admix-haak2015massive-oceania-K#.sh
```

You will likely need to change the path to the programs DyStruct and ADMIXTURE in each script.
